You should therefore carefully consider whether holding any crypto tokens is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to hold any crypto tokens, you should be aware that the price or value of cryptocurrencies can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Tokens or any cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central banks or national, supra-national, or quasi-national organizations. They are also not backed by any hard assets or other credit. The value of tokens or any cryptocurrencies is affected by several factors, including but not limited to, the total number of tokens or any cryptocurrencies in existence, the continued willingness of market participants to exchange government-issued currency for tokens or cryptocurrencies, purchasers' expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies, purchasers' expectations with respect to the rate of deflation of cryptocurrencies, interest rates, currency exchange rates, cyber theft of cryptocurrencies from online crypto wallet providers, or news of such theft from such providers or individuals' crypto wallets, investment and trading activities of large investors, monetary policies of the governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations, regulatory measures, the global or regional political, economic or financial events, and situations. Thus, all these factors will affect the value of tokens or cryptocurrencies, which may result in the permanent partial or total loss of the value of the Company, a particular token or cryptocurrency. No one will be obliged to guarantee the liquidity or the market price of any of GAFI or cryptocurrencies maintained in your Wallets.
